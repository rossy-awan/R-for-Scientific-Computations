# R for Scientific Computations

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **R scripts and notebooks** designed for scientific computing. The resources in this collection aim to help students, researchers, and self-learners understand and implement core scientific principles and data-driven models using **R** as a flexible and powerful platform.

## Contents

### Basic to Intermediate R Programming
- Arithmetic, power, logarithmic, and root operations
- Factorials, trigonometric functions, and complex numbers
- Control structures: conditionals, loops, and functions
- Boolean logic and relational operators
- Basic plotting and custom visualizations

### Numerical Methods
- Root Finding: Bisection, Newton–Raphson, Secant
- Numerical Differentiation: Central differences
- Numerical Integration: Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule, Newton–Cotes
- Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs): Euler, Heun, Midpoint, Runge–Kutta 4
- Interpolation: Linear, Cubic Spline
- Regression: Linear, Nonlinear, Logistic
- Optimization Techniques: Nelder-Mead, BFGS

### Data Science & Statistics

## Getting Started

1. Open the `.R` or `.Rmd` files in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
2. Install the required packages using `install.packages("package_name")` if prompted.
3. Run scripts section by section or knit the R Markdown files for full output.
4. Modify parameters or datasets to explore behavior and performance.
