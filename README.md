# R for Scientific Computations

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **R scripts and notebooks** designed for scientific computing. The resources in this collection aim to help students, researchers, and self-learners understand and implement core scientific principles and data-driven models using **R** as a flexible and powerful platform.

## Contents

### Basic to Intermediate R Programming
- Arithmetic, power, logarithmic, and root operations
- Factorials, trigonometric functions, and complex numbers
- Control structures: conditionals, loops, and functions
- Boolean logic and relational operators
- Basic plotting and custom visualizations

### Numerical Methods
- Root Finding: Bisection, Newton–Raphson, Secant
- Numerical Differentiation: Central differences
- Numerical Integration: Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule, Newton–Cotes
- Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs): Euler, Heun, Midpoint, Runge–Kutta 4
- Interpolation: Linear, Cubic Spline
- Regression: Linear, Nonlinear, Logistic
- Optimization Techniques: Nelder-Mead, BFGS

### Data Science & Statistics
- Descriptive Statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, IQR, range, summary tables
- Distribution Analysis: skewness, kurtosis, histograms with density plots, boxplots
- Probability Analysis: unconditional & conditional probabilities, cumulative frequency & probability tables
- Correlation & Covariance: covariance matrix, Pearson, Spearman, Kendall correlations
- Confidence Intervals: t-based intervals for each variable
- Coming soon

  - Using decision trees to perform regression tasks
  - Evaluation of RMSE and R²

- Random Forest (Classification)
  - Classification of the `iris` dataset using `randomForest`
  - Feature importance visualization and performance metrics

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Classification of the classic `iris` dataset
  - Feature scaling and accuracy evaluation
  - Experimentation with multiple values of `k`

- Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA)
  - Using the built-in BJsales dataset for demonstration
  - Performing Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity
  - Plotting Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation
  - Building and comparing manual ARIMA models (with specified orders) and automated ARIMA models (auto.arima)

- Decision Trees & Random Forest with Grid Search for Binary Classification
  - Hyperparameter tuning for decision trees and random forests
  - Grid search implementation for optimal parameters

## Getting Started

1. Open the `.R` or `.Rmd` files in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
2. Install the required packages using `install.packages("package_name")` if prompted.
3. Run scripts section by section or knit the R Markdown files for full output.
4. Modify parameters or datasets to explore behavior and performance.
